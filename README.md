## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

**Please remember to update this section**

Our topic/interest is in understanding and visualizing of the changes of educational importance over year with another focus on seeing if education has improved. Over the years, more importance is put on completing schooling and progressing to Post-Secondary Education, but has Secondary education completion rates increased or decreased? As well as if the location of the school or district correlates to a difference in completion rates or the rate is fairly general all-over British Columbia.  
Ideas:
Private vs public
special needs (lack of a better word) increase(?) better support
Completion rates over time & with new midsets
