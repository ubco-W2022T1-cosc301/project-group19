# Group 19 - Basic Education Changes Over Time


## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our topic/interest is in understanding and visualizing of the changes of educational importance over year with another focus on seeing if education has improved. Over the years, more importance is put on completing schooling and progressing to Post-Secondary Education, but has Secondary education completion rates increased or decreased? As well as if the location of the school or district correlates to a difference in completion rates or the rate is fairly general all-over British Columbia.


Ideas:
Private vs public
Disability Students (lack of a better word) increase(?) better support
Completion rates over time & with new midsets


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset demonstrates the British Columbia Completion Rate for high school students between the years of 1997/98 to 2020/2021/ The dataset is broken down by district, city, and grade. Additionally, the dataset separates students into categories of indigenous, non-indigenous, students with disabilities and the general student population. Furthermore, the data includes cohort information which will allow us to decipher the change in education students were receiving and compare the education format towards the succession rate. This data is provided by the Government of British Columbia, which we speculate was for public interest and accountability. We plan to use this dataset for public interest and as a form of accountability to the British Columbia Ministry of Education. Lastly, graduation data records are available to the public, and this dataset is formed from public school records.
