## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our interest is to utilize our dataset to understand and visualize the barriers and/or intricacies that British Columbians face through the completion of their high school career. We strive to determine if certain groups of people, including Indigenous people or people with disabilities have lower completion rates due to the ongoing barriers they’ve faced, and whether or not the completion rates have improved over time with the increase in technology and awareness. Furthermore, we would like to investigate if societal changes such as the introduction of modern-day technology has had an impact on the completion rates. Because of the apparent increase in careers requiring a post-secondary diploma over time, we would like to examine if this has impacted student determination to receive their Dogwood. Additionally, we seek to determine any relationships between a school’s geographic location/district and city population size and students’ high school completion rates. We want to spread awareness on barriers that British Columbian students face throughout their high school career, which could be used by the government or other agencies to distribute funding to improve the BC education system. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset demonstrates the British Columbia Completion Rate for high school students between the years of 1997/98 to 2020/2021/ The dataset is broken down by district, city, and grade. Additionally, the dataset separates students into categories of indigenous, non-indigenous, students with disabilities and the general student population. Furthermore, the data includes cohort information which will allow us to decipher the change in education students were receiving and compare the education format towards the succession rate. This data is provided by the Government of British Columbia, which we speculate was for public interest and accountability. We plan to use this dataset for public interest and as a form of accountability to the British Columbia Ministry of Education. Lastly, graduation data records are available to the public, and this dataset is formed from public school records.
