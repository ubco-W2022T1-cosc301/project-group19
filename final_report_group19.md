## Question 3:

#### To discover if graduation rates have declined or risen over time and to consider what environmental factors could lead to these changes.

Figure 1. acts as an excellent visual when trying to understand completion rates over the years. The graph begins in 1997 and peaks in 2021 (the end of our dataset). While the graph does have slight variations over the years, it is clear that there was a higher graduation rate as time went on. I believe there is currently more pressure on students to graduate highschool and it is definetly considered the the societle norm to recieve your highschool education and diplThe graph above is an excellent visual for understanding completion rates over the years. The graph begins in 1997 and peaks in 2021 (the end of our dataset). While the graph does have slight variations over the years, it is clear that there was a higher graduation rate as time went on. There is currently more pressure on students to graduate high school, and it is considered the social norm to receive your high school education and diploma at a minimum. The steepest peak of my graph occurs between 1987 and 1989, where the estimated completion rate line is almost vertical on the graph. Figure 3. is an asset in understanding the graduation rates, as you must understand the correlation between the attendance rates and completion rates to realize that the majority of students are very successful. The similarity between the two graphs is promising.

Regarding my research question, graduation rates/completion rates have risen since 1997. I initially wondered if the introduction of modern-day technology would lead to an incline in graduation rates as there is a perception that technology is making us lazy but also that technology provides access to online education. Some students may drop out of public schools for a preferable online learning system. When analyzing the data, my hypothesis was incorrect, and there is not a large enough decline in completion rates to make this a considerable argument.oma at minimum. The steepest peak of my graph occurs between the years of 1987 and 1989 where the estimated completion rate line is almost vertical on the graph.

Figure 3. helps analyze geographical factors and estimated completion rates. I have presented this graph using District numbers which can be attributed to each matching District name, which provides the school's location in question. This data is incredibly valuable as it shows the estimated completion rates for each district. While lower does not mean not as successful, and we must consider the community's population. It is still interesting to view as it hints at the size of each district; assuming the majority of school-aged adolescents within each section are receiving an education, it can lead to conversations with the teenage population in that area.


#### The size or population of a cohort, how many students are in each one - all following the same curriculum.

#### I want to gain a more extensive understanding of how cohorts work, how many students are in cohorts and if a cohort affects graduation or success rates in students. This ideology leads to my internal understanding of the school systems and their successes and flaws. If, while examining the data, I found a significant drop in a cohort's success rate, I may be able to attribute the decline to the format and content those students were learning or what world events were happening at that time.

#### I want to consider the estimated outmigrants as well and examine if there were periods of time when more students were leaving the school district than others.

## Conclusion:
Tie it all together like a nice little bow and finish it up  - A stuff
