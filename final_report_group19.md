# Introduction
The dataset our group has chosen is from the British Columbia Ministry of Education. It demonstrates the British Columbia Completion Rate for high school students between the years of 1997/98 to 2020/2021 with information on cohorts, students, success rates, outmigrant counts and more. We believe it is essential to understand our province's success rates and high school information as we entrust the British Columbia Ministry of Education to teach the following generations. With this in mind, it becomes relevant to understand whether the curriculum students follow is working successfully. We were also interested in population compared to completion rates as a trend of low completion rates in areas with smaller populations could hint at a more significant problem that those in British Columbia should be aware of. Lastly, as students ourselves, we were curious about how the completion rates have changed over time and if there was a more extensive importance on education or less of a priority since 1997. Overall our role as students has led us to feel particularly passionate about this data, especially since 2/3 of our group members are included in this dataset.

#### To discover if graduation rates have declined or risen over time and to consider what environmental factors could lead to these changes.

**Figure 1.** acts as an excellent visual when trying to understand completion rates over the years. The graph begins in 1997 and peaks in 2021 (the end of our dataset). While the graph does have slight variations over the years, it is clear that there was a higher graduation rate as time went on.

The graph begins in 1997 and peaks in 2021 (the end of our dataset). While the graph does have slight variations over the years, it is clear that there was a higher graduation rate as time went on. There is currently more pressure on students to graduate high school, and it is considered the social norm to receive your high school education and diploma at a minimum. The steepest peak of my graph occurs between 1987 and 1989, where the estimated completion rate line is almost vertical on the graph. Figure 3. is an asset in understanding the graduation rates, as you must understand the correlation between the attendance rates and completion rates to realize that the majority of students are very successful. The similarity between the two graphs is promising.

Regarding my research question, graduation rates/completion rates have risen since 1997. I initially wondered if the introduction of modern-day technology would lead to an incline in graduation rates as there is a perception that technology is making us lazy but also that technology provides access to online education. Some students may drop out of public schools for a preferable online learning system. When analyzing the data, my hypothesis was incorrect, and there is not a large enough decline in completion rates to make this a considerable argument.oma at minimum. The steepest peak of my graph occurs between the years of 1987 and 1989 where the estimated completion rate line is almost vertical on the graph.

**Figure 3.** helps analyze geographical factors and estimated completion rates. I have presented this graph using District numbers which can be attributed to each matching District name, which provides the school's location in question. This data is incredibly valuable as it shows the estimated completion rates for each district. While lower does not mean not as successful, and we must consider the community's population. It is still interesting to view as it hints at the size of each district; assuming the majority of school-aged adolescents within each section are receiving an education, it can lead to conversations with the teenage population in that area.

#### The size or population of a cohort, how many students are in each one - all following the same curriculum.

**Figure 4.** visualizes the number of students in a cohort per year. Considering how many students are learning the same curriculum simultaneously is interesting. This graph answers my second research question regarding pure cohort sizes. In 1997/1998, the cohort size was considerably more significant than the cohort sizes in 2021; from this, I wonder what strategic choices are behind deciding cohorts and what benefits smaller cohorts have. Based on the data, smaller cohorts are the preferred method as the sizes do not reach anywhere close to the range that was 1997/1998. The data trends towards smaller cohort sizes, and 2020/2021 cohort is one of the smallest. These cohorts refer to grade eight and forward; I would have been considered within this data in the 2014/2015 cohort, which was slightly smaller than the year before and somewhat bigger than the year to follow, demonstrating the downward trend.

#### I want to gain a more extensive understanding of how cohorts work, how many students are in cohorts and if a cohort affects graduation or success rates in students. This ideology leads to my internal understanding of the school systems and their successes and flaws. If, while examining the data, I found a significant drop in a cohort's success rate, I may be able to attribute the decline to the format and content those students were learning or what world events were happening at that time.

**Figure 5** demonstrates the correlation. For the purpose of my research questions, I will focus mainly on those with the highest correlation - SUCCESS_COUNT and COHORT_COUNT. This data is the most interesting within the dataset as it considers whether the cohort is successful. SUCCESS_COUNT and COHORT_COUNT are 0.99 on the correlation scale and 0.1% from being identical. From this, I gather that the first is that most cohorts are successful, which makes sense considering my experience within high school and the attendance and population rates I personally experienced. Additionally, this graphic shows a low correlation between the district number and the estimated completion rates. Initially, I wondered if more rural areas (as determined by the district number, which is equal to the district name/area) would have lower estimated completion rates as those districts may have less access to funding than the larger populated districts. I am glad to discover that the community's position has little effect on the students' success.

#### I want to consider the estimated outmigrants as well and examine if there were periods of time when more students were leaving the school district than others.

**Figure 6.** considers the number of students who left British Columbia during the school year and did not return before the school year ended. This data began with high levels of students departing or out-migrating at the beginning of the study/dataset. This number seemed to steady starting in the 2000s and only fluctuated slightly. The years tend to move gradually (Minus the date from the 1990s). 2020/2021 has the lowest outmigrants data of the set, which makes sense considering the COVID-19 Pandemic drastically limited the way British Columbians were able to move around the country. However, the numbers, even at most, remain relatively low regardless of highs or lows. Within the thousands of students within the British Columbia education system, the number of students departing remains relatively low, with this chart only needing to go to 400 on the X axis.
## Conclusion:
Tie it all together like a nice little bow and finish it up  - A stuff
